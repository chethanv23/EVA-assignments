#FEED FORWARD NETWORKS and Back propagation

the first layer taking in inputs and the last layer producing the output. The middle layers have no connections with the external world and hence are called hidden layers. Each neuron or perceptron in one layer is connected to every perceptron on the next layer. Hence information is constantly "fed forward" from one layer to the next

Each of the circles is actually a neuron, but each line is the weight we are training and are of importance to us. Those circles are "temporary" values that will be stored. Once we train the model, lines are what all matter!

These lines are denoted by w's where i and j are the neurons it is connecting together.

Here i1 and i2 are the Input neurons and h1 is neuron created from wights w1 and w2 and Input layers i1 and i2.

a_h1 activated layer which is activated h1, as an activation parameter we used sigmoid

 singmoid fumction  = o(x) = 1/1+e(-x)

h1 = w1*i1+w2*i2
h2 = w3*i1+w4*i4
a_h1 = σ(h1)=1/(1+exp(-h1))
a_h2 = σ(h2)=1/(1+exp(-h2))
o1 = w5*ah1+w6*a_h2
o1 = w7*ah1+w8*a_h2
a_o1 = σ(o1) =1/(1+exp(-o1))
a_o1 = σ(o1) =1/(1+exp(-ho2))

Etotal is the total combined errors E1 and E2

THE error we considered here is MSE - Mean Squared error.

Etotal = E1+E2
E1 = 0.5(target1 - a_o1)^2
E1 = 0.5(target2- a_o1)^2
